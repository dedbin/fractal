# Mandelbrot Set Renderer

This is a script that renders the Mandelbrot set using the arrow keys on the keyboard right to increase, left to decrease, up to closeup, down to zoom out the number of iterations, 
which significantly increases the resolution. You can also navigate through the set using the WASD keys. 
Additionally, there are three possible textures that can be changed by modifying the texture variable.

The code is written using the Taichi library, which greatly improves performance.
